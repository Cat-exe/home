            <div class="intro">
                <p>Hi! I'm Carol, and I enjoy problem solving and finding new productivity hacks to make life easier.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Background <i class="em em-mortar_board" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="GRADUATION CAP"></i></h2>
            <p>I studied at Brooklyn College and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in 2019. During my time there, I subjected myself to healthy stress by participating challenging hackathons, built everlasting connections with colleagues in STEM, and grew via accountability and taking responsibility for my work.</p>
            <p>I have taken coursework in both Computer Science and Mathematics and aspire to create a culturally competent class environment to educate and share my passion for problem solving and logic with others.</p>

            <h2>What I Do <i class="em em-female-teacher" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i></h2>
            <p>As an educator, I apply what I know and what I love to my job: tinkering with code, finding solutions, and helping others - but, most importantly, having fun while doing so!</p>
            <p>My goal is to help students become better thinkers, and articulating what they know versus what they don't know is always the first step. Master the basics, and you can apply it anywhere you choose.</p>
            
            <ol class="experience">
                <p>I currently teach in the Brown Scholars Program for BridgeUP:STEM @ the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
                <li>I teach the Brown Scholars about the wonders of Data Science, and its intersection between Computer Science and Natural Science. We use datasets gathered from the museum to learn basic Python syntax, practicing data manipulation techniques and creating visualizations for six scientific unit projects throughout the school year.</li>
                <li>I mentor a group of 6 brilliant interns in a year-long project dedicated to the application of their Python skills. We are studying the epidemiological impact of COVID-19 on society, while learning how to implement various new computer science topics like Machine Learning and Web Design to share our findings. </li>
            </ol>

            <ul class="quotes">
                <p> I live by the following words:</p>
                <li>"Simplicity is bliss."</li>
                <li>"No one is better than me, and I'm not better than anyone."</li>
                <li>"Time waits for no one, so make the best use of it."</li>
                <li>"Learn what is to be taken seriously, and laugh at the rest."</li>
                <li>"There is never nothing to do."</li>
            </ul>
